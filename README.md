# kartoffel

starter pack for a ðŸ¥” [kartoffels](https://github.com/patryk27/kartoffels) ðŸ¥”
bot

## usage

clone this repository, run `./build` and then upload `./kartoffel` into
[the game](https://kartoffels.pwy.io)

(if you're more into terminals, there's `ssh kartoffels.pwy.io`)

note that this repository provides a skeleton robot meant mostly for the in-game
tutorial - it probably won't survive long when deployed onto the battlefield

## caveat emptor

when creating a kartoffel you're implementing a firmware, so you don't have
access to `std` - no `std::fs`, no `println!()` etc. you can communicate through `serial_send()`, though, and you can use various fancy things like `vec` or
`format!()` via the `alloc` crate, just add `extern crate alloc;`

you're given 64 khz cpu and 128 kib of ram, godspeed
